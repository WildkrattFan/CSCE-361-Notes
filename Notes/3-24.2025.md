Cloud computing basics
---
___
Cloud computing is a model for enabling convientient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources

on premise means that it is local

cloud computing is rapidly provisioned and released

provides high level abstraction of computation and storage model

it has some essential charactersitics, service models, and deployment models 

Essential characterstics 
- On - demand self service 
- heterogeneous access
- reource pooling 
- emeasured service

Examples of saas (software as a service)
---
- google apps, salesforce, dropbox. mailchimp, zendesk, docusign, slack, hubspot

platform as a service (PaaS)
---

- AWE elastic beanstalk, herokum windows azure, etc

Infastructure as a surface
---
- you get to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources
- you can deploy arbitrary software 
- consumer doesnt manage or control the underlying cloud infastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, deployed applications and possibly limited control of select networking components

deployment mdels

- private cloud 
- community cloud
- hybrid cloud

diadvantages of cloud computing
- requires internet
- doesnt work well with low speed connections
- you get what you get
