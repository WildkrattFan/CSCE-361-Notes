SOLID principles
- S is single responsibility principle
- O stands for open closed principle
- L is Liskov substitution principle
- I Interface segregation principle
- D Dependency injection principle

Seperation of concerns 
- it is bad practice to shove everything into one file

Minimize the effects of change

S - single responsibility principle
---
- Every class should only concentrate on doing one thing
- or having one purpose
- utility classes don't have to follow single responsibility handling as much

Cohesion & Coupling
---
Coupling - how tightly integrated things are
Coupling = dependencies 

Cohesion - how things belong together
Cohesion = belonging of functionalities 

Single responsibility principle enforces high levels of cohesion 

Ideally have high cohesion and low coupling 

O - Open closed principle 
---
- software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification
- Change a class' behavior using inheritance and composition 

- start with the most generic things possible & add things on by extending things on in a sub class
