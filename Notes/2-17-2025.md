Things in utilities in the I Design
- logging
- messaging 
- publisher/subscriber
- localization 
SOLID principles dont apply to utilities

Engine only deals with data contracts, never interacting with the database directly 

engine doesnt do any routing, will never send or recieve anything from the view(front end)

interface for everything - design for change
