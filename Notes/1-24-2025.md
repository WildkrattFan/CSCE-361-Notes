Goals of Agile CM
--

Goals: in an agile environment with multiple teams
the version control model needs to achive the following goals:

- fail fast
    - code conflicts and integration problems should be discovered as soon as possible
    - better to fix small problems often than to fix large problems seldom
- always releasable
    - even after a really bad sprint there should be at least something that is releasable
- simple
    - all team members will be using this scheme every day so the rules and routines must be clear and simple
