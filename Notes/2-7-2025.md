Altering a class means you have to alter the tests and continuous integration pipeline 

Liskov Substitution Principle 
---
Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their sub types without altering the correctness of that program
- we must make sure that new derived classes are extending the base classes without changing their behavior 

Interface Segregation Principle 
---

Clients shold not be forced to implement interfaces they dont se instead of one fat interface many small intrefaces are preferred based on groups of methods, each one serving one sub module 
- no client consuming an interface should be forced to depend on methods it doesnt use
