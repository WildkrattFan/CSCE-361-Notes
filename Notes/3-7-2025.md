Regression Tests - tests that you know already work and rerunning them when you add new code to make sure the new code didnt break the old code 

gated ci - before the CI the tests are all run

commit at the end of the work day a version that works, just comment out stuff that doesnt work if it is still in progress

Build machine - machine dedicated to running the automated build process
