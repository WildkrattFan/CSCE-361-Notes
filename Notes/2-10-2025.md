Interface Segregation Principle 
---
clients should not be forced to implement interafces they dont use instead of one fat interface, many small interfaces are preferred based on groups of methods, each one serving one sub module
- no client compuming an interface should be forced to depend on methods it doesnt use

- open closed principle only applies for interfaces not in the design

Dependency Injection - DI
---
High level modules shouldnt depend on low level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions
- high level modules and low level modules are kept decoupled as much as we can
- decouple dep from implementation 
- pretty much lets you pass in paramaters instead of locking yourself into one implementation 
- email sender example: do I want to use google, yahoo, outlook etc?
