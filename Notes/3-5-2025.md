Fakes - objects that have working implementations but not the same as the production version - simplified version of production code

stub - object that holds predefined data and uses it to answer calls during tests - when we dont want to use real data

Mock - objects that register calls they recieve

Integration tests are much less granular than unit tests

in integration tests you can use fakes mocks and stubs

continuous integration - these tests run every time you make a change

- always building a working version of your system every day

when you push
- checks version of system
- builds it, runs all test and verifies passes
- if it passes creates new offical version
- if it doesnt notifies appropriate devs

it is  a dev ops practice

- focus on failing fast
