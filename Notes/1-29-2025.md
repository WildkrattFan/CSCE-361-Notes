 Software Process Model and Introduction to Agile

- Process Model - A way you do a certain set of tasks
- A standardized way to accomplish software development 

___Quiz Question: What are some aspects of software complexity or the task complexity___

- complexity of the task itself
- resources available 
- Time constraints 
- Money
- many moving parts

CRUD - create read update delete

What is a process
- specification
- Design and implementation
- Validation
- Evolution 


- A software process model is a simplified representation of a process. It presents a description of a process from some particular perspective 

Black Box process:
- tell you a set of requirements 
- people who gave you requirements dont know what happens
- product produced
- good for projects that have very specific requirements 
    - ex: security systems, NASA

White box process:
- you get the requirements 
- as you develop the stakeholders provide feedback on your work
- you continue to redevelop and rework until stakeholders are happy
- you can negotiate with the stakeholders
- product produced 

Waterfall- black box process
Evolutionary, incremental, iterative - white box --- all are kinda agile 


Agile is a method that breaks down a project into multiple iterations

Iteration = Sprint (typically two weeks)
Analysis -> Design -> Implementation -> Testing
2 sprints = release (typically 1 month)


in the first sprint less is expected from you kinda


Vertical - All of the business concerns that run through the project 

Stack = Vertical 

Agile advantages:
- allows changes to be made after the product is requested

Agile itself is not a process, it is a type of process
