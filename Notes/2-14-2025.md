Constructor injection - taking the abstracted version and passing the interface name with a variable into the class

Vertical - business need that encompasses the entire tech stack

Method injection - you are saying exactly how to do it by passing in a method/class not a constructor

- makes it so you are no longer dependent on a speciic implementation 

- can let you map things from the interface to different implementation 
    - there may be different methods if you have a google email sender, yahoo email sender etc

Ninject is another mapping framework
Unity framework for DI is all of the mapping and stuff

DI -> Constructor -> Iemailsender

DI -> method -> PostArticle() -> IEmailSend 

constructor injection - an interface treated as SOME abstract implementation of the interface, lets you change things without being too complicated

IoC and DI
- the terms DI and Inversion of Control are generally used interchangeably 

IDeign - gives the freedom to respond quickly to change and allow future changes to "cost less"

iDesign layers:

Manager - (IManager) - 
Engine - (IEngine) - 
Accessor - (IAccessor) - 

contains multiple verticals of all 3

just like MVC you have a datasource (DB)

Managers - routing and workflow - typically updates the ui
Engine - does work - computation, logic, algorithms, any kind of processing 
Accessor - Communicates dirrectly between Managers and Engine, accesses the database/datasource - CRUD operations - reporting work - could update the ui

Data contracts = model - reflections of whats in the database


try not to talk between stacks
a

Data contract - a representation of the data, think a user object
