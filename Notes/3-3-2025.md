Unit testing part 2
---
___

Test driven development (TDD)

- write the test assuming method exists
- then write the method

Engine needs to be tested most 

Managers need tested

Utility functions need tested


using statements allow you to free memory that you use in unit tests (garbage collection) - use them in the thing that is being tested not the actual test

(use for things besides just unit tests too dont get confused with the using (aka import statements) at the top of the file)

using statement just makes sure that when you are done using the memory for the code it is thrown out

you can define timeouts for your tests so they dont run forever

tests should avoid logic
